Hello, I'm Summer Xing 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a financial analyst turned full-stack software engineer based out of New York City, NY. I'm passionate about creating solutions to enhance user experiences. My work experience as an equity investment professional and an academic background in public policy have equipped me with the ability to solve complex problems, maintain an analytical mind, and communicate across different parties. With an open mind, I strive to contribute my tech expertise to create efficient products. I recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote, and I'm actively looking for junior SWE roles. During my cohort, I completed numerous lab assignments and four projects which you could find below 🙂
